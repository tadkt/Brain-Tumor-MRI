1) Everyone break-in with Pytorch and model such as Neural Network and CNN.
- Suggesting: find in Kaggle.com some notebooks subjected to your domains (pre-processing, GANs, metaheuristics)
- Pre-processing: https://www.kaggle.com/code/farzadnekouei/enhanced-mri-brain-tumor-classification#Step-3.3-%7C-Augmentation-of-Dataset-with-Artificially-Degraded-Images
- GANs: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bunnyyy/gan-implementation-from-scratch-using-pytorch
- Metaheuristics: https://github.com/stratzilla/metaheuristic-training-networks/tree/master
- or: https://github.com/EnchanterXiao/PSO-CNN.git

Kien and Ha's CNN MRI Brain Tumor notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/tadktthai/simple-cnn-mri-brain/

2) Advanced Integrating novel available techniques
- Metaheuristics: Integrating PSO into CNN MRI
- GANs: Lam, Dung integrating pairwise data to gen from MRI to CT
- Preprocessing: try to remove the skull

=> Make a survey: table column: dataset, paper, accuracy, computation time (try 4-class classification)

3) Testing new models
- GAN: segment-then-GAN, attention-based GAN
- Metaheuristics: Applying PSO to transfer learning or ViT
